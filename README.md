PROJECT 2 README

./build.sh      TO BUILD MY APPLICATION

RUN ALL SCRIPTS FROM THE SRC FILE

TO RUN THE S2 TESTS, USE s2script.sh

FOR SOME REASON, DS-CLIENT AND MY CLIENT's INTERPRETATION OF NEWLINES DO NOT PLAY ALONG
IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE A SET OF RESULTS FROM SCRATCH,
GENERATE THEM USING:

python3 ./s2_test.py "java Main -a ass" -c S2TestConfigs

AND ONCE THEY REACH THE CLIENT, CTRL C AND RUN

python3 ./s2_test.py "java Main -a ass" -n -c S2TestConfigs -r results/ref_results.json

WHERE THE -r FLAG POINTS TO THE RESULTS YOU JUST GENERATED

THANK YOU SORRY FOR THE MESS BUT THERE ARE ALOT OF ASSIGNMENTS DUE
